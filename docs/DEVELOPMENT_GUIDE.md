## 🚨 **Important Notes**

### **Don't Modify Legacy System**

- **Read and reference** legacy code
- **Don't edit** legacy files directly
- **Use as inspiration** for modern implementation

### **Keep Projects Separate**

- **Modern dependencies** stay in `percytech-modern/`
- **Legacy dependencies** stay in `legacy-system/`
- **No shared node_modules** between projects

### **Multi-Branding Focus**

- **Build generic first** - Core SMS functionality
- **Add compliance later** - Industry-specific features
- **Enable customization** - Brand-specific UI and rules

---

## 🎯 **Daily Workflow**

### **Morning Setup**

```bash
cd /Users/bryan/Dev/percytech-modern
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### **During Development**

```bash
# Work in modern platform
# Reference legacy system when needed
cd ../legacy-system/client/src/components
# Study patterns, then return to modern platform
cd ../../frontend
```

### **End of Day**

```bash
# Commit modern platform changes
cd /Users/bryan/Dev/percytech-modern
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```
